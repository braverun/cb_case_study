# Optimizing Investment Campaigns: A Data-Driven Approach

## Project Overview:
During my comprehensive data science bootcamp, I led a small-group project centered around optimizing client selection for a second round of an investment campaign. The primary objective was to enhance campaign performance by targeting 3,000 clients with the highest likelihood of investment, striking a balance between costs & expected revenue. I coordinated our group's pipeline development & managed Git repositories on Github, ensuring smooth collaboration by assisting with changes, pull requests, & code conflicts.

## Phase 1: Target Selection
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand historical campaign performance
- Used various modeling approaches to recommend 3,000 client IDs for the second round
- Applied machine learning techniques, optimizing hyperparameters for model performance
- Demonstrated business acumen with a convincing summary for stakeholders

## Phase 2: Post-Campaign Analysis
- Prepared a presentation with interactive Dash dashboards
- Compared expected campaign performance with actual results
- Evaluated performance against random target selection, advocating for the data-driven model
- Extracted insights to inform future strategies

## Techniques:
- Data Handling: Downloaded, loaded, and performed EDA on the dataset
- Feature Engineering: Enhanced modeling through feature engineering
- Machine Learning: Built and optimized models, considering interpretability
- Pipeline Integration: Wrapped the process in a pipeline for efficiency

## Impact & Results:
- Demonstrated data-driven benefits over random selection
- Provided actionable insights for portfolio strategy improvement
- Suggested innovative ideas for optimizing campaign performance
- Successfully selected 3,000 clients, contributing to enhanced campaign performance
- Compared actual and expected metrics for informed decision-making
- Positioned the project as a strategic blend of technical prowess and business strategy
